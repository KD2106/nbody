# Simulation of an N-Body System under the Gravitational Force

- In this program we use numpy arrays to store the mass, position, velocity, and acceleration of the N bodies in our system. Each of these quantities is stored in an N x 3 array. 

- We use Leap-Frog integration to solve the differential equation associated with the system (**F** = m ** a **), and plot the evolution of the system in 3D using matplotlib.

- This project was inspired by a similar project created by Philip Mosz: https://github.com/pmocz/nbody-python
